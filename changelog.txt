Version: 1.4.9
Date: 4-10-25
  Changes:
    - Loader electricity usage adjusted and now increases per tier
  Fixes:
    - Sanity check when creating insulated/data pipe from default pipe, this mitigates crashes caused by multi layered sprites. (Revealed by Muluna 1.34.2) While it will not crash, other mods changing entities to use multiple layer sprites will cause insulated/data pipe graphics to display incorrectly. Proper resolution pending.
    - Electronic components now tied to EI electronic parts technology. Reported by @Vasishtha
    - Spidertron limiter updated to use 2.0s new lua logistics commands, setting a logistic request on the spidertron will no longer cause a crash. Reported by @debuasgaming

Version: 1.4.8
Date: 4-10-25
  Changes:
    - Loaders now require electricity and can be wired
    - Arc Furnace energy requirement 5MW -> 30MW, pollution value 0 -> 6
    - Plasma Heater energy requirement 20Mw -> 70MW, craft speed 1 -> 1.25, now accepts Quality module, pollution value 0 -> 3
    - Caster module slots 1 -> 2, now accepts Quality module, pollution value 0 -> 1
    - Skip converting Fulgora oceans into crude oil if Fulgora Extended is enabled & chemical-mire-gives-muck is enabled
  Additions:
    - Colorful animated glow effects for Arc Furnace, Plasma Heater, Gate, & Caster working states. (Current sprites imported from Glow Trees; credit to asher_sky)
    - Loader Complexity Patch: Startup setting which significantly increases material input complexity for loaders and REWARDS YOU by enabling filtering for the Express loader and stacking for the Neodymium loader
    - Rocket lift capacity multiplier added to startup settings
    - Entity update cycle length adjustment added to startup settings. This setting determines over how many ticks the 8 entity update stages run. Default 60 ie all entities are looped once per 60 ticks ie 1 second
  Fixes:
    - Additional checks to prevent null references in on tick updater & gate updater
    - Startup settings tooltips were configured inconsistently, tooltips should all work now
  Notes:
    - Several quick fixes have been implemented to allow the use of K2 imports, final implementations pending

Version: 1.4.3
Date: 04-04-25
  Changes:
    - UPS optimisation, thanks to 1righteousgod @ Discord
    - Bugfixes
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.4.0
Date: 03-04-25
  Changes:
    - Platform requests scanner - constant combinator outputting orbiting platform requests sorted by platforms. Can be connected to logistic container in set requests mode.
    - Ported Fueler Tower, can insert burnable fuel to vehicles and take burnt results
    - Also made fueler supply ammo-turret, artillery-turret, artillery-wagon in range from it own inventory 
    - Fueler inventory larger and support filters
    - Ported supersonic EM-trains, with working to full extent EM trains upgrade technologies
    - Ported several Krastorio entities: steel pipe, steel pump, planetary teleporter, wind turbine, gas power station, energy storage, deitherium fusion reactor, advanced steam turbine, antimatter reactor, immersite quarry drill, small roboport, big roboport, greenhouse, electrolysis plant, filtration plant, atmospheric condenser, fluid flare stack, advanced chemical plant, quantum computer, matter plant, matter associator, stablizer charging station, air purifier, fluids, intermediates, immersite and antimatter ammo and rockets, and intergalactic transceiver
    - Rockets can lift up to 20 tons, starter pack weight 20T and create platform with 2000 foundation
    - Larger rocket silo inventory, use custom minimum payload from hub gui to deliver underfull rockets
    - Biolabs feed on nutrients instead of electricity
    - Stone brick can be crushed back to stone  
    - Large foundry fluid buffer
    - Can dump items to water tiles on Nauvis, Gleba, Aquilo as well as on Fulgora
    - Oil ocean yields crude oil
    - Artificial soil can be placed anywhere
  Notes:
    - Plans to rework rockets later with expensive but reusable carrier rockets and expendable cargo pods
    - Port more entities to place in Simulation Computer Age stage thats looks quite empty now comparing to others
    - Will balance / simplify / merge recipes and items during gameplay
    - K2 intergalactic transceiver - working, but without victory trigger, for use in scenario, that, maybe will be later
