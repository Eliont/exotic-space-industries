# Exotic Space Industries (ESI)

**Fork of _Exotic Industries_ by PreLeyZero — now continued and expanded under the GNU General Public License v3 or later (GPL-3.0-or-later).**

Exotic Space Industries carries forward the original vision of Exotic Industries, updates it for Factorio 2.0 Space Age, and layers on new mechanics (K2 integration, aesthetic spectacle, etc.). Every file that originated in the upstream mod remains under the GPL; all new work inherits the same licence.
